<!-- SECRET_KEY. This is a secret key that is used as part of Django's website security strategy. If you're not protecting this code in development, you'll need to use a different code (perhaps read from an environment variable or file) when putting it into production. -->

<!-- DEBUG. This enables debugging logs to be displayed on error, rather than HTTP status code responses. This should be set to False in production as debug information is useful for attackers, but for now we can keep it set to True. -->
